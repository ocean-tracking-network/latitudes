  title: "Data: Effects of seismic airgun playbacks on swimming patterns and
    behavioural states of Atlantic cod in a net pen"
  abstract: "We tracked individual fish using acoustic telemetry and exposed them
    to sound. Here, we provide (1) the raw acoustic tag detections, (2) the
    filtered/processed tag detections which served as an input for YAPS
    (Yet Another Positioning Solver), (3) the positions of the hydrophones
    (acoustic tag receivers), and (4) the positions of the fish (output of YAPS)
    and other relevant covariates (sun elevation, tide and treatment period)."
